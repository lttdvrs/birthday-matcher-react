Bieber went on to become the first solo artist to have four singles enter the Top 40 before the release of a debut album. His 2009 album, My World, went platinum in several countries. He later experienced significant media exposure from offensive activity. Nonetheless, the singer made his comeback in 2015 with his first number one song, 'What Do You Mean?' His 2017 collaboration with Luis Fonsi, “Despacito,” broke the all-time record for most consecutive weeks at the number one spot on the Top 100.

His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed 'the world's most famous equation'. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.

She started her musical career in her early teens as a vocalist for the R&B group B2K.

In 2002, she debuted as a playback singer for the soundtrack of the film 'The Master of Disguise' by contributing vocals to the song 'Cherry Pie.' She also appeared in her former boyfriend O'Ryan's debut video 'Take It Slow.' She predominantly works with genres, such as R&B, Hip-Hop, and Rap. Her single '3:16 AM,' which she released under the popular publishing house A&R, increased her popularity; the song was made available for digital download on iTunes. She achieved international recognition when she joined Canadian rapper Drake to contribute to his album 'Nothing Was the Same.' In May 2014, her single 'The Worst' reached the No.1 spot in ‘US Billboard R&B /Hip-Hop-Airplay’ category and peaked at the 11th position in ‘Hot R&B /Hip-Hop’ songs. In 2015, she was nominated for ‘Grammy Awards’ in three categories."
